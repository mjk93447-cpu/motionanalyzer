# FPCB Domain Guardrails

## Project Goals (Priority Order)

**Goal 1 (Highest)**: Bending-in-process crack detection — temporal, local.
- Causes: over-curing, excessive bending trajectory, too fast bending speed.
- Detect: pre/post-crack subtle velocity changes, shockwave, vibration, subtle length change (crack-induced gap).

**Goal 2**: Already-cracked panel detection — global pattern.
- Pre-damaged FPCB with subtly different properties/structure → different trajectory and abnormal physical patterns.
- Damage very small, differences subtle → use various AI models to precisely distinguish.

## Domain Rules

- Always model FPCB as layered organic film + copper composite.
- Prefer physics-informed surrogates over arbitrary random trajectories.
- Keep side-view bending progression realistic: straight -> arc -> U-like.
- Include scenario semantics when generating data: normal, crack, pre_damage, thick_panel, uv_overcured.
- Tie each scenario to observable metrics (final bend angle, curvature concentration, temporal response).
- Preserve reproducibility with explicit parameters and metadata outputs.
- When proposing thresholds, label them as provisional until secure-site calibration.
- Never claim absolute stress/strain truth without measured material constants.
- For production-facing decisions, emphasize limitations of 2D surrogate models.
