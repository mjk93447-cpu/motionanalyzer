# FPCB Domain Guardrails

- Always model FPCB as layered organic film + copper composite.
- Prefer physics-informed surrogates over arbitrary random trajectories.
- Keep side-view bending progression realistic: straight -> arc -> U-like.
- Include scenario semantics when generating data: normal, crack, pre_damage, thick_panel, uv_overcured.
- Tie each scenario to observable metrics (final bend angle, curvature concentration, temporal response).
- Preserve reproducibility with explicit parameters and metadata outputs.
- When proposing thresholds, label them as provisional until secure-site calibration.
- Never claim absolute stress/strain truth without measured material constants.
- For production-facing decisions, emphasize limitations of 2D surrogate models.
