# Cursor Tooling Optimization

- Prefer project skill `.cursor/skills/ai-coding-accelerator/SKILL.md` for coding tasks.
- Use shell tools for command execution, validation, and reproducible checkpoints.
- Keep command usage deterministic and concise; avoid ambiguous one-liners.
- For long multi-step sessions, use compaction-aware workflow:
  - close one objective before starting the next
  - summarize decisions after major milestones
  - move durable guidance into rules/skills, not transient chat turns
