# Project Goals (docs/PROJECT_GOALS.md)
- Goal 1 (highest): Bending-in-process crack detection — temporal, local (velocity change, shockwave, vibration, length change).
- Goal 2: Already-cracked panel detection — global pattern (subtle property/structure difference).

- Prefer explicit typed functions and deterministic numeric processing.
- Keep frame-order handling stable by sorting input filenames before parsing.
- For vector metrics, always document units: pixel, pixel/s, pixel/s^2.
- Write tests for parser edge cases and numeric calculations.
