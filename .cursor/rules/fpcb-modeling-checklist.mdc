# Modeling Change Checklist

- Split assumptions into geometry, mechanics, and materials.
- Keep equations consistent (`kappa`, `R`, `epsilon`) and units explicit.
- Output diagnostics (`frame_metrics.csv`, metadata) for every synthetic run.
- Add scenario-specific validation logic and failing messages.
- Add/update tests for at least one positive and one negative condition.
- Document any new parameter with physical meaning in docs.
