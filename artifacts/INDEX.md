# Artifacts Index

This directory stores large generated outputs that are not required for core repository comprehension.

## Policy

- Keep source code, canonical docs, and summary reports in tracked paths.
- Keep bulky outputs under `artifacts/archive/` with date-based folders.
- Link artifacts from `reports/INDEX.md` and `indexes/corpus-index.json` when needed.
